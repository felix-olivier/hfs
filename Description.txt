Folder 'Scandium' contains all programs needed to fit hfs multiplets, but only for scandium transitions (quantum number I is not an input parameter and is defined as 7/2 in multiple programs).
Additionally, a program to calculate log(gf) values for hfs transitions can be found in this folder. The fine structure gf value needs to be given as an input parameter.


Folder 'Any Atom' contains all programs needed to fit hfs multiplets for any element. Quantum number I is given as an input parameter.
Additionally, a program to calculate log(gf) values for hfs transitions can be found in this folder. The fine structure gf value needs to be given as an input parameter.

Folder 'Extra' contains some additional programs.
