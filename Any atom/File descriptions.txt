LSQcurvefit_noread and LSQcurvefit_read are the programs that execute the fitting routine.
The synthetic spectrum is generated in function IcreatorB. 
The sixj symbols are calculated using the following programs: sixjsymbol, delta6j
The functions of quantum numbers to obtain the wavenumbers of hfs components are calculated
using programs: Ccalc, Dcalc

Uncertainties are derived using: determine_delta
The pure spectrum is fitted using: fitpure. The synthetic spectrum is then generated using:
create_hfpat (essentially the same as Icreator).

plot_synth_obs_func_gen allows to plot and compare an synthetic spectrum with the observed
spectrum.

hfsloggf_calculator is used to calculate hfs gf values.

Scdata18_cal_SNR is the observed spectrum.
